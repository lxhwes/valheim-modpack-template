Config Directory for valheim-modpack-template

This directory is where you should place configuration files for the mods included in your modpack.

Structure:
- BepInEx/config/ - Contains configuration files for BepInEx and mods that use BepInEx's configuration system
- Other directories - Some mods may require configuration files in specific locations

When adding configuration files to your modpack:
1. Test the configurations thoroughly to ensure they work as expected
2. Document any significant configuration changes in your main README.md
3. Ensure the configurations are compatible with each other
4. Consider creating a separate document explaining your configuration choices

Note: The example configuration files included in this template are for demonstration purposes only.
You should replace them with your own configurations for the mods you include in your modpack.
